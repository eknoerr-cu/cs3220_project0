# Deliverables

- **Stakeholder interview notes - [interviews.md](interviews.md)**
- **Persona(s) - [personas.md](personas.md)**
- **Top 10 user stories - [user_stories.md](user_stories.md)**
- **Acceptance criteria  - [acceptance_criteria.md](acceptance_criteria.md)**
- **Wireframe(s)**
- **Annotations - [annotation.md](annotation.md)**

# Directions

## Stakeholder interviews
- 2+ people (non-School of Engineering students)
- don't need names, just profiles of the students
- might be helpful to utilize student planning as a reference  

## Personas
- determine types of users that will interact with the application
- can be creative, but must be realistic
    
## User Stories
- need at least ten, but more are okay
- don't feel the need to have an exhaustive list, will add throughout the project
- using the [MoSCoW method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/product-management/moscow-prioritization-in-product-management/) for prioritizing
- try to think through stories in each level
  
## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition

**Acceptance criteria** are explicit, testable conditions that a user story must satisfy in order to be considered complete. They remove ambiguity by specifying *observable behavior* rather than implementation details.

Each **Must-have** and **Should-have** user story must include **2–5 acceptance criteria** written in clear, verifiable terms.

Acceptance criteria should:

* Be written from the **user’s perspective**
* Describe **system behavior**, not UI aesthetics or code design
* Be testable by a peer or instructor without access to the codebase
* Avoid vague language (e.g., “easy,” “fast,” “user-friendly”)

### Acceptance Criteria Format

**Given / When / Then  (Preferred)** 

* Given [precondition]
* When [user action]
* Then [expected outcome]

**OR**

**Bullet-based conditions**

* The system shall…
* The user can…
* The application displays…

## Wirefames
- can draw by hand (submit as image files), use HTML or online tool (export)
- must be grayscale, basic fonts
- must have a header/navigation area and 4 content wells (Plan, Requirements, Finder, Status)
- annotations gives context to the wireframe document
- example document - [annotation_example.md](annotation_example.md)
